If the user found that it can not do re-registration, he may choose to initiate a new initial-registration in the FULL IMS environment. That may help network to reselect a new S-CSCF. Then the new selected S-CSCF will notify HSS to do correction. If we forbidden that function, that also means user maybe not get service until the recorded S-CSCF recover. For every registration time HSS can only return the recorded S-CSCF in the Cx-UAA message. That means if user found that he can\'t do periodic registration then nothing he can do until S-CSCF recover. He also can not get any IMS service during that period time. That we think is not user or operator would like. From our view we think we should give network flexibility to recover from the error, and not introduce that error to user and make them feel not convenience to use.',

That is why the service-based interface goes hand-in-hand with the messaging bus that can be found in almost all consolidated architectures (e.g. IRF, MIF, MRFF). Note that in the extreme case the messaging bus can provide a full-mesh connectivity among all NFs, although only some connections in the full-mesh may actually make sense. The definition of a service-based interface can co-exist with the "traditional" P2P architecture. The P2P architecture can be viewed as an essential graph with minimal connectivity that is needed for enabling the basic mobile system to work.',
